# TODO

I need to talk about the changes that have been made in the media server
* Change Cloudflare Tunnels for DDNS
* The implementation of Caddy Server for reverse proxy and SSL
* Change the the docker container from Docker Desktop to Docker "native" in the system
* Using the Transcoding options of the CPU by the Video Acceleration API (VA-API) to convert video files to reproduce them in different devices
