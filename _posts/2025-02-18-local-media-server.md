# Background

I have always liked to have my content locally, until now what I did was use a USB to store the files I wanted to see on my TV, but since adding new content was very tedious, I decided to start this project

# The project

Since I wanted it to be local, I decided to use an old laptop I have at home (A Samsung with an Intel Core i3, 8 GB RAM, 240 GB SSD) as a local server using [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) as the OS and the 1TB USB as extra storage.

I used [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) since I wanted to learn how to use it. As a media server I decided to use [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) since it is open source. To access data remotely while on the network use [Samba](https://www.samba.org/samba/). In order to publish it on the web at the beginning I used [duckdns](https://www.duckdns.org/) and [port forwarding](https://portforward.com/). Then I decided to purchase a [domain](https://nehemiasfeliz.com/) and set up a tunnel using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/es-es/) for more security.

You can take a look to [the project](https://media.nehemiasfeliz.com/):

Username: Guest

Password: 1234

```
Notes:
Since this is a small, personal project, not a streaming service, I've limited the Guest user as follows:
- Only a small portion of content can be accessed
- Only 10 simultaneous sessions allowed
- Limit internet streaming bitrate (Mbps) to 1
- Periodically I will log out and change the user's password
```

# Setting up Local environment

After a clean installation of Debian, I set a static IP on my local network. After installing Docker I learned how to allow it to access devices such as USB in a easy way, I created a docker compose file with the necessary configurations to download and start the server.

![dockerjellyfin](/assets/images/posts/localmediaserver/dockerjellyfin.png)

After doing the initial configuration of Jellyfin and setting up the media library, I could already access it from any device within the network with the local IP and port. First achievement.

# First attempt to go online

The project could have ended in the previous step, but I wanted my family members who don't live with me and my friends to also be able to enjoy this project.

My research on how to remotely access the server led me to investigate DNS, although the public IP address could be enough, I wanted it to be easier to access than putting numbers in the browser, so looking for DDNS providers I found Duckdns, a service that offered just what I needed (Free). I didn't care that it was a subdomain, since it was a simple and personal project.

### Dealing with ISP's dynamic IP addresses
Even though Duckdns provided a way to make my server more accessible, the public IP my ISP provides changes over time. To ensure that Duckdns always points to the correct IP, it provides several [options](https://www.duckdns.org/install.jsp) to automate the task of updating the public IP address. In the end, since I didn't want to install anything on the OS, I opted for a docker image made by the [linuxserver](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/duckdns) community.

### Port Forwarding
Port forwarding is a way of making a computer on your home network accessible to computers on the internet. Normally by "opening" the necessary ports in the router configuration and setting parameters such as "from" and "to" which IPs the traffic will be forwarded.

![portfowarding](/assets/images/posts/localmediaserver/portfowarding.png)

After that configuration I was able to access the server from any network just adding the open port at the end of the url.

And once again, I could have left the project as was, but something didn't sit well with me:
*   It was connected via HTTP (not secure)
*   I was afraid of what could happen in case of DDOS attacks (unlikely but it never hurts to be safe)

![httpnosecure](/assets/images/posts/localmediaserver/httpnosecure.png)

So I decided to keep investigating...

# Using the proper technologies

The research led me to learned about Cloudflare.

After understanding well how the process would be, I had to buy a domain, since although Cloudflare provided what I needed (HTTPS and DDOS protection) for free, I could not continue using DuckDNS, so I had to buy a domain, Cloudflare allows you to buy domains, which made the process of setting it up much easier.

The next thing to implement was their tunneling system.

### Cloudflare Tunnels
Definition:
> Cloudflare Tunnel provides you with a secure way to connect your resources to Cloudflare without a publicly routable IP address. With Tunnel, you do not send traffic to an external IP â€” instead, a lightweight daemon in your infrastructure (cloudflared) creates outbound-only connections to Cloudflare's global network. Cloudflare Tunnel can connect HTTP web servers, SSH servers, remote desktops, and other protocols safely to Cloudflare. This way, your origins can serve traffic through Cloudflare without being vulnerable to attacks that bypass Cloudflare. [1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)

Example:

![cloudflaretunnels](/assets/images/posts/localmediaserver/cloudflaretunnels.webp)

Cloudflare provides several ways to install these tunnels, as you can imagine I chose the option of doing it through docker.

![cloudflaretunnelinstaled](/assets/images/posts/localmediaserver/cloudflaretunnellinstaled.png)

Whit that i'm be able to create subdomains/routes that link to IP addresses on my local network, said subdomains/routes being accessed through HTTPS by SSL certificates without having to open/expose any ports on my router.

![cloudflaretunnellinked](/assets/images/posts/localmediaserver/cloudflaretunnellinked.png)

And with that, now I can say that for now, I have completed the project. A local media server for me, my family and friends.

# Future plans and limitations

### Problems and Limitations

The main limitation of the project is its low processing capacity due to the hardware, poor physical protection of the data and scalability.

Processes such as scanning the library, extracting information from files or transcoding when transmitting take up all the capacity of the CPU, making its use very limited to simply being a very basic media player, not taking advantage of all the options that Jellyfin has.

Using an external USB as a storage medium is a simple implementation, but I know that it does not have the best read/write times and that when exposed it runs the risk of being disconnected/damaged by many factors and the loss of information that this entails.

Mention that since it is an old laptop, its battery is not working, so it depends exclusively on its charging cable, making any power outage cause the computer to shut down immediately.

### Solutions

The primary solution is not to depend on external power, buy a battery replacement and provide a UPS for any power outage.

The next long-term solution will be to change the computer to one with more processing capacity, increase storage with dedicated SSDs (possibly implementing RAID for more reliability) and maybe use [proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) to be able to use the equipment for more projects.

### Future plans

Implement [Bakcups](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/backup-and-restore) with periodic information, not about the videos themselves, but about the server configuration among other data relevant to the project.

Implement wake-up-lan so that in case of a power failure or sudden shutdown, the laptop can be turned on remotely.

Plan the migration to the new computer taking into account the recommendations/tools proposed by the [documentation](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/migrate).

Implement [LDAP Authentication](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/plugins/#ldap) for the automatic management of new users with default options, thus facilitating access to new users with whom you share the project.

# Conclutions

The best thing about working in this industry is that any project you want to make, whether for personal or professional use, involves setting challenges and learning new technologies that will surely be useful for your next job or work project.
