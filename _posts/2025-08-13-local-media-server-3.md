# TODO

I need to talk about the changes that have been made in the media server
* The implementation and integration of Shoko Server for the managing of anime series
* Automating the import/download of new files for use in Shoko/Jellyfin by torrent
* Unifying different folders into one for easier access and scalability
* Implementing a personal DNS/reverse proxy to redirect requests to Jellyfin/Shoko directly to the server without leaving the local network
